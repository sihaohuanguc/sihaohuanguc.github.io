## 2023
### May 21 - 24
I participated in the [UChicago Computational Biology Trek to Bay Area](http://www.mychoice.uchicago.edu/about-the-program/experience/treks/computationalbiology23/) and visited many companies including Genentech, Abbvie, Epic Bio, 23andme, Maze, Interline, Grail and Baker Bioenginuity Hub. I learnt a lot about companies of all sizes from established to startup ones. It was an amazing experience!

### Feb 18 - 24
I attended the GRC and GRS conferences for Translation studies in Houston. This was the first time that I did **off-line** oral presentations (due to the pandemic) in a nation-wide conference and it was challenging, but I made it! I met a lot of new friends and learnt a lot about the methodology and strategies for research on translation. This is directly useful in my following project.

## 2022
### Dec 07
I just had a committee meeting talking about my research progress in 2022. It was wonderful discussion with the committee members and they gave me lots of useful suggestions. 2022 was a great year and hope 2023 will also be a great one!

### Oct 14
I did a poster presentation at 2022 UChicago Molecular Biosciences Retreat! I talked to many faculties and students about nanopore seq technology and the results. Also new results are on the way. Hope to share about more results in the near future. It was a great journey to the Q center.
