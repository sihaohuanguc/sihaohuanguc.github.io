## 2022
### Dec 07
I just had a committee meeting talking about my research progress in 2022. It was wonderful discussion with the committee members and they gave me lots of useful suggestions. 2022 was a great year and hope 2023 will also be a great one!

### Oct 14
I did a poster presentation at 2022 UChicago Molecular Biosciences Retreat! I talked to many faculties and students about nanopore seq technology and the results. Also new results are on the way. Hope to share about more results in the near future. It was a great journey to the Q center.
