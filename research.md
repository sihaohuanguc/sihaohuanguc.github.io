# Research
## Interferon inducible pseudouridine modification in human mRNA by nanopore profiling
In this project, we developed a machine learning based method "NanoPsu" to identify pseudouridine (psU) modifications in human transcriptome from Nanopore sequencing data. We trained the model based on known psU sites in rRNA from multiple species. The method is applied to Interferon (IFN) treated samples and IFN induced genes are found to possess more psU. The open source Python package for psU prediction could be found [here](https://sihaohuanguc.github.io/Nanopore_psU/). News report about this work could be found [here](https://biologicalsciences.uchicago.edu/news/pseudouridine-sequencing-mrna-vaccines).
## Genome-wide mapping reveals that deoxyuridine is enriched in the human centromeric DNA
In this project, we developed a NGS-based method named dU-seq for genome-wide mapping of deoxyuridine (dU) in human cells. Thousands of dU sites are revealed in human cells and they are found to be enriched in centromeric DNA, especially in CENP-A (a histone H3 variant) binding regions.
## To be continued
More published results will be shown.
