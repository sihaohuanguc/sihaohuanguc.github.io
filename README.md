<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sihao Huang, I'm currently a PhD candidate at University of Chicago. My thesis mentor is Prof.Tao Pan. My research focus is **Bioinformatics**. I mainly work on developing computational methods to identify base modifications on genome and transcriptome through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Nanopore Sequencing. I enjoy collaborating with researchers with different academic backgrounds like chemistry, cell biology, immunology, microbiology and CS.

I started my PhD program at University of Chicago in Sept 2018. This would be my 5th year in Chicago. I got my B.S. degrees in Biology and Mathematics at Peking University in Beijing.
