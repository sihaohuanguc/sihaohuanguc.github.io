# About

<img style="float: right;" src="./docs/assets/images/Titlis.jpg">

My name is Sihao Huang. I'm currently a PhD candidate at University of Chicago. My thesis mentor is Prof. [Tao Pan](https://bcmb.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/tao-pan). My research focus is **Bioinformatics**. I mainly work on developing computational methods to identify base modifications on genome and transcriptome through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Nanopore Sequencing. Machine learning is involved in the models. I also write open sourse python packages to make the approaches availble to general users. I participate in projects of many biological directions with bioinformatics methods and tools, like immunology, microbiome, COVID19, cell biology, etc. I enjoy collaborating with researchers with different academic backgrounds like chemistry, cell biology, immunology, microbiology and CS.

<br/>
I got my B.S. degrees in Biology and Mathematics at Peking University in Beijing in 2018. I started my PhD program at University of Chicago in Sept 2018. 2022 would be my 5th year in Chicago. I will graduate in 2023 or 2024. After that, I plan to search for an industry job of Bioinformatics or Data Science in US.

<br/>
I like cycling along the shore of Lake Michigan. I like building [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us) models. I like cooking. I like traveling. I've visited 12/50 states in US and hope to visit more in the future.
