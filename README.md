My name is Sihao Huang. I've got a PhD at University of Chicago. My thesis mentor is Prof. [Tao Pan](https://bcmb.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/tao-pan). My research focus is **Bioinformatics**. I mainly work on developing computational pipelines to identify base modifications on genome and transcriptome and understand their functions in metabolism and diseases through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Nanopore Sequencing. Machine learning is involved in the predictive pipelines. I also have industry experience in developing machine learning models for cancer diagnosis from cell free DNA and multi-omics data integration pipelines for biomarker discovery. I write open source [python packages](https://github.com/sihaohuanguc) to make the approaches available to general users. I participate in projects of many biological directions with bioinformatics methods and tools, like immunology, microbiome, COVID19, cell biology, etc. I enjoy collaborating with researchers with different academic backgrounds like Computer Sciences, Organic Chemistry, Cell Biology, Immunology and Microbiology.

<br/>
I got my B.S. degrees in Biology and Mathematics at Peking University in Beijing in 2018. I started my PhD program at University of Chicago in Sept 2018. I graduated in May 2024 and is now searching for an industry job of Bioinformatics, Computational biology or Data Science in US.

<br/>
I like cycling along the shore of Lake Michigan. I like building [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us) models. I like cooking. I like traveling. I've visited 12/50 states in US and hope to visit more in the future.
