# About
![titlis](./docs/assets/images/Titlis.jpg)
<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sihao Huang. I'm currently a PhD candidate at University of Chicago. My thesis mentor is Prof. [Tao Pan](https://bcmb.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/tao-pan). My research focus is **Bioinformatics**. I mainly work on developing computational methods to identify base modifications on genome and transcriptome through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Nanopore Sequencing. Machine learning is involved in the models. I also write open sourse python packages to make the approaches availble to general users. I enjoy collaborating with researchers with different academic backgrounds like chemistry, cell biology, immunology, microbiology and CS.
<br/>
<br/>
I started my PhD program at University of Chicago in Sept 2018. 2022 would be my 5th year in Chicago. I got my B.S. degrees in Biology and Mathematics at Peking University in Beijing in 2018.
<br/>
<br/>
I like cycling along the shore of Lake Michigan. I like building [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us) models. I like cooking. I like traveling. I've visited 12/50 states in US and hope to visit more in the future.

# News
1. I'm going to do a poster presentation at 2022 UChicago Molecular Biosciences Retreat on Oct 14-15!
2. A new co-authored paper has been submitted afrer revision on Monday, Sep 12. Hope to see it online soon!
