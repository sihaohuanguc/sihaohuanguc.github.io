# About

My name is Sihao Huang. I'm currently a Postdoc at New York Genome Center working with Prof. Chenxu Zhu. I got my B.S. degrees in Biology and Mathematics at Peking University in Beijing in 2018. I got my PhD degree at University of Chicago in 2024. My PhD thesis mentor is Prof. [Tao Pan](https://bcmb.uchicago.edu/program/faculty/tao-pan). My research focus is **Bioinformatics**. During my PhD research, I developed machine-learning-based computational pipelines NanoPsu and NanoSPA to identify multiple types of mRNA modifications simultaneously from nanopore direct RNA sequencing data and explored their roles in immune response and translation regulation. I wrote open source [python packages](https://github.com/sihaohuanguc) to make the approaches available to general users. I also did industry internships in developing machine learning models for cancer diagnosis from cell free DNA and multi-omics data integration pipelines for biomarker discovery. I enjoy collaborating with researchers with different academic backgrounds like Computer Sciences, Organic Chemistry, Cell Biology, Immunology and Microbiology.

I liked to cycle along the shore of Lake Michigan when I was in Chicago. I like building [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/en-us) models. I like cooking. I like traveling. I've visited 14/50 states in US and hope to visit more in the future.
